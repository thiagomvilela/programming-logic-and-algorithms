## Project description

The Logic Programming Online Course is the first training course for anyone wishing to enter the world of IT. In fact, you use logic for everything in your day-to-day life. When you make your coffee, you use logic. When you go to school, you use logic. And even to invest in a course at Becode you use logic.

Anyway, we use logic for almost everything in our lives, nothing fairer that we also use it for the IT area. You will see that all subjects related to IT necessarily use concepts and practices that will be taught during this course:

- You need to develop a website, programming logic;
- A software, needs programming logic;
- That sensational report in Excel, programming logic;
- A mobile app for your boss/client to access anytime, anywhereâ€¦ programming logic needed!

That is, for you to grow and evolve within the huge universe that IT encompasses, it is necessary that you have an excellent knowledge base on programming logic, which is the main objective of this training!
